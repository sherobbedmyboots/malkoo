Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow. Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. The five boxing wizards jump quickly. Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
