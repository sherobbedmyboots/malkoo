- Code                                                     Each instruction in the program is executed.  Some instructions manipulate data. Some instructions call functions from the libraries (DLLs) the program has loaded.
 
- Stack                                                     This is a Last In First Out (LIFO) data structure the CPU uses to store temporary data valuesâ€”A POP reads from the stack, a PUSH writes to the stack
 
- Registers/EFLAGS                            These are small areas of fast memory the CPU uses for logical operations and temporary storage during processing
 
- Memory of program                       The memory locations allocated to a program which are constantly being read, written, or modified
